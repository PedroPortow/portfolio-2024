        <div className='container  mt-4 flex flex-row gap-8'>
          <p className='text-lg w-1/2 text-light-gray text-justify'>Hey! I'm a 20-year-old Full Stack Web Developer and Computer Science student at Universidade Federal de Pelotas. I have a passion for creating and designing software that not only functions efficiently but also provides an intuitive user experience. </p>
          <p className='text-lg w-1/2 text-light-gray text-justify'>
            My journey in web development started with basic HTML and CSS, and it quickly evolved into a love for JavaScript and full-stack technologies. 
            I've been honing my skills in both front-end and back-end development,
            with a particular interest in modern frameworks like React for the front-end and Ruby on Rails for the back-end. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with the latest trends in the tech world. My goal is to continually grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.
